# Advent-of-Code-2024

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 programming challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of daily coding puzzles, starting from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents a new problem that challenges problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and coding skills.
